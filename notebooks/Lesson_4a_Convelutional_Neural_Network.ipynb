    "Convolutional neural networks are cool because the nature of the \"convolution\" adds the property of translational invariance to image recognition tasks - e.g. it doesn't matter where in the image we are, we can still recognize if an object is \"there\".\n",

    "## Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "A kernel is centered over a pixel in the source image. A kernel is a tensor of weights - each corresponding weight and pixel (within the 'view' of the kernel) are multiplied together and summed. This is done for each pixel in the image to create a new convoluted image. For edge pixels, we can use zero-padding.\n",

    "Max-pooling is the process of simplifying the data in an input image by summarizing data in uniform regions."
